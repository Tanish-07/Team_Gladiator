Aim Practice Web App
The Aim Practice Web App is designed to help users improve their shooting accuracy. The app has a clean and intuitive user interface, which allows users to focus on improving their aim without any distractions.

The app consists of a target shooting game where users can practice their aim by shooting at moving targets. Users can customize the difficulty level of the game by adjusting the speed of the targets.

In addition, the app has a leaderboard feature that allows users to compete with their friends and see who can score the highest.

Development Process
Our team started by brainstorming ideas and sketching out the user interface of the web application. We then proceeded to develop the front-end of the application using HTML and CSS.

Once the front-end was completed, we moved on to developing the game logic using JavaScript. We extensively tested the app to ensure that it was bug-free and provided an optimal user experience.

Conclusion
Unfortunately we ran into some errors and the project didn't worked as expected  but We hope you enjoyed our Aim Practice Web App as much as we enjoyed developing it. Our team is committed to delivering high-quality web applications that provide value to users. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us.

Thank you for choosing the Aim Practice Web App by Team Gladiators.
